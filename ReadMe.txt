AVL Tree in c

This tree was made for holding pointers instead of integers. 
The objective was not to make something perfect, but to ease my burden every time i need a tree to hold different data structures.

Note on when to use AVL Tree instead of Black Tree

AVL Tree should be used when many read operations need to be performed
Black Tree should be used when many write operations need to be performed
