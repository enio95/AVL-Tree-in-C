AVL Tree in c

This tree was made for holding pointers instead of integers. 
The objective was not to make something perfect, but to ease my burden every time i need a tree to hold different data structures.

Note: This method may be slower than simply having a tree to hold integers and having an array to hold the data structure. Frankly
its a valid concern!

Note on when to use AVL Tree instead of Red Black Tree

AVL Tree should be used when many read operations need to be performed
Red Black Tree should be used when many write operations need to be performed
